This is a simple and interactive website that simulates drum sounds when specific keyboard keys are pressed.
Each key is mapped to a different drum sound, such as a snare, kick, crash and a kick bass.
When the user presses a key, the corresponding sound plays instantly, creating a fun and engaging way to experiment with rhythm using only the keyboard.
This project is great for learning basic web development concepts like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, especially event handling and audio playback.
This codes were done following Mrs. Angela Yu steps in the The Complete Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp (2025) in the Udemy platform.
